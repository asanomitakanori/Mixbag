> Learning from label proportions (LLP) is a promising weakly supervised learning problem. In LLP, a set of instances (bag) has label proportions, but no instance-level labels are given. LLP aims to train an instance-level classifier by using the label proportions of the bag. In this paper, we propose a bag-level data augmentation method for LLP called MixBag, based on the key observation from our preliminary experiments; that the instance-level classification accuracy improves as the number of labeled bags increases even though the total number of instances is fixed. We also propose a confidence interval loss designed based on statistical theory to use the augmented bags effectively.


## Requirements
* python >= 3.9
* cuda && cudnn

We strongly recommend using a virtual environment like Anaconda or Docker.
The following is how to build the virtual environment for this code using anaconda.
```
# pytorch install
$ pip install torch==1.9.1+cu111 torchvision==0.10.1+cu111 torchaudio==0.9.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
$ pip install -r requirements.py
```

## Dataset
```
./dataset
    â”œâ”€â”€ train
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ train_imgs                       
    â”‚        â”œâ”€â”€ sequence001                # Each sequence has 300 images 
    â”‚        â”œâ”€â”€ sequence002
    â”‚        â”œâ”€â”€ :
    â”‚        â””â”€â”€ sequenceN                       
    â”œâ”€â”€ val  
    â”‚   â””â”€ val_imgs                          # Same structure of train_imgs
    â”‚        â”œâ”€â”€ sequence011                # Each sequence has 12 images 
    â”‚        â”œâ”€â”€ sequence015
    â”‚        â”œâ”€â”€ :
    â”‚        â””â”€â”€ sequenceM  
    â””â”€â”€ test
         â””â”€â”€ test_imgs                       # Same structure of train_imgs.
              â”œâ”€â”€ sequence011                # Each sequence has 300 images 
              â”œâ”€â”€ sequence015
              â”œâ”€â”€ :
              â””â”€â”€ sequenceM  
```
